As far as I can tell the only thing that I added 
that was outside of reference was what another 
classmate suggested which was to add a question 
mark after int and initializing the inverse member 
so that it was optional to leave a void. This meant 
that I needed to use that has value in order to 
determine easily if it actually has a value. It 
seemed like an easier way to determine which kind 
of construction I would need to use.

...pretty simple haha.
